        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>The first step will be to ensure you are up to date with any current outstanding applications. These are applications that haven’t been responded to yet (always respond to applications oldest --> newest). Interviewing is a vital part of the hiring process, and being a good interviewer ensures that you get the most out of each interview.
Holding interviews allows you to get a full sense of what the candidate is actually like. In face-to-face interviews, you can get a better impression of the candidate's personality, behavior, and poise in the context of discussing business and the type of work the candidate needs to be able to perform.</p>

          <h3>Standby Locations</h3>
          <p>We would rather our customers didn’t have to wait long periods of time for our services so we have set up standby locations which provide ease of use. If a location seems unpopular at a specific time then the driver should relocate to a different standby location. Only 3 taxis may be parked at each location at any time to ensure there is no overcrowding. During these waiting times, you may converse and get to know your fellow colleagues but make sure to prioritize taking requests, you may go to people and ask them if they need a lift anywhere.</p>
